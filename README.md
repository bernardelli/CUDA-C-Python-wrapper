<h1> Building a  CUDA/C++ Python Wrapper with CMake</h1>

This repository will give you a short example on how to build a C++ class with CUDA bindings into a  Python wrapper.

<h3>Why would I use this?</h3>
It is a good idea to test a larger CUDA/C++ project with all the swiftness and convenience of Python.

<h3>Why CMake?</h3>

CMake is a great tool when you want a project to run on different computers with different OS or library paths, but sometimes writing the CMake configuration file can be a pain in the ass. I managed to make it work, so enjoy  :wink:

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

* CMake
* pybind11
* CUDA
* Python

<h3>To Do list</h3>

- [x] make it work on Visual Studio
- [ ] clean up the code and write useful comments
- [ ] make it work on Linux/gcc
- [ ] write some cool examples here
